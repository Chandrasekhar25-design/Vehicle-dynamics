Project 1: Spring and Anti Roll bar selection based on vehicle targets.
-Selection of the spring and anti-roll bar for a 4WD sedan with a Mcpherson strut in the front and Multilink in the rear. Vehicle level targets to calculate suitable numbers for the selected subsystems and performed calculations for:

1. Spring Rates
2. Rear Ride frequency and flat ride plots
3. Anti-characteristics
4. Roll bar diameters


Project 2: Roll bar selection, Tire stiffness plots and Understeer budget for a light sports vehicle.
-Selection of suitable Rollbar for a light sports vehicle and an understeer budget. The Rollbar diameter selection and the understeer budget should comply with vehicle level targets like Roll gradient and understeer gradient. Used given parameters to come up with a detailed excel sheet that gives the appropriate numbers of the roll bar selection and understeer budget sheet.
